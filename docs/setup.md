Then
```bash
pip install earthmover
```
which will install `earthmover` and the packages it depends on.

Verify that `earthmover` has successfully installed with
```bash

Next, [configure your project](configuration.md), or `earthmover init` to [initialize a sample project](usage.md#earthmover-init).
