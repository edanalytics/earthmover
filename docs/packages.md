Packages are `earthmover` projects that are designed to be shared, reused, and built upon. They may contain seed data, template files, and an `earthmover.yml` with `sources`, `transformations`, and `destinations` that define a (potentially partial) data transformation graph, as well as a README explaining how to use the package.

Here we maintain a list of packages for various domain-specific uses:

* Packages for transforming [assessment data files from various vendors to the Ed-Fi data standard](https://github.com/edanalytics/earthmover_edfi_bundles)

If you develop packages, please consider contributing them to the community by publishing them online and emailing the link to [treitz@edanalytics.org](mailto:treitz@edanalytics.org) to get them listed above.
